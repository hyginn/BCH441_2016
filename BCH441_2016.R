#        READ THIS FIRST
# ==============================================================================

# == HOW TO WORK WITH THE FILES IN THIS PROJECT ================================
#
# The files in this project will be continuously updated throughout the term
# to support your code development and R exercises.
#

# If you wish to edit any of the code, for example to add your own comments and
# examples, save any edited version under a different name. Otherwise you will
# have problems with git when you update the project to a new version.

# DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THIS FILE!

# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an
# answer, or ask me. Don't continue if you don't understand what's going on.
# That's not how it works ...
#
# While this file itself should not be edited by you this is YOUR project
# directory, and files that you create (notes etc.) will not be harmed when you
# pull updated version of the master, or other new files, from github.
#
# If you pull from github and get the following type of error ...
#     ---------------
#     error: Your local changes to the following files would be
#     overwritten by merge
#     ...
#     Please commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
#     ---------------
# ... then, you need to bring the offending file into its original state.
# Open the Commit window, select the file, and click on the Revert button.
#
# Of course, you can save a local copy under a different name before you revert,
# in case you want to keep your changes.
#
#
# ==============================================================================

# == TASK: LOCAL SCRIPT ==
# To help keep the files of this project which are under version control intact
# for future updates from github, use
#     File -> New File -> R script
# ... and create a new script for your own code experiments and notes.
# You can name the file   "myCode.R"
#

# ==== THE CURRENT ASSIGNMENT ==================================================
# execute:

file.edit("BCH441_A03.R")

# ... and close this tab.
