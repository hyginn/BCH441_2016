# This tutorial covers basic concepts of graph theory and analysis in R. You
# should have typed init() to configure some utilities in the background.


# ==============================================================================
#        PART ONE: REVIEW
# ==============================================================================

# I assume you'll have read the Pavlopoulos review of graph theory concepts.
# Let's explore some of the ideas by starting with a small random graph."


# To begin let's write a little function that will create random "gene" names;
# there's no particular purpose to this other than to make our graphs look a
# little more like what we would find in a publication ...
makeRandomGenenames <- function(N) {
    nam <- character()
    while (length(nam) < N) {
        a <- paste(c(sample(LETTERS, 1), sample(letters, 2)),
                   sep="", collapse="") # three letters
        n <- sample(1:9, 1)             # one number
        nam[length(nam) + 1] <- paste(a, n, sep="") # store in vector
        nam <- unique(nam)   # delete if this was a duplicate
    }
    return(nam)
}

Nnames <- makeRandomGenenames(N)

Nnames

# One way to represent graphs in a computer is as an "adjacency matrix". In this
# matrix, each row and each column represents a node, and the cell at the
# intersection of a row and column contains a value/TRUE if there is an edge,
# 0/FALSE otherwise. It's easy to see that an undirected graph has a symmetric
# adjacency matrix (i, j) == (j, i); and we can put values other than {1, 0}
# into a cell if we want to represent a weighted edge.

# At first, lets create a random graph: let's say a pair of nodes has
# probability p <- 0.1 to have an edge, and our graph is symmetric and has no
# self-edges. We use our Nnames as node labels, but I've written the function so
# that we could also just ask for any number of un-named nodes, we'll use that later.

makeRandomGraph <- function(nam, p = 0.1) {
    # nam: either a character vector of unique names, or a single
    #        number that will be converted into a vector of integers.
    # p:   probability that a random pair of nodes will have an edge.
    #
    # Value: an adjacency matrix
    #
    if (is.numeric(nam) && length(nam) == 1) { # if nam is  a single number ...
        nam <- as.character(1:nam)
    }
    N <- length(nam)

    rownames(G) <- nam
    colnames(G) <- nam
    for (iRow in 1:(N-1)) { # Note how we make sure iRow != iCol
        for (iCol in (iRow+1):N) {
            if (runif(1) < p) {  # runif() creates uniform random numbers
                                 # between 0 and 1
                G[iRow, iCol] <- 1   # row, col !
                G[iCol, iRow] <- 1   # col, row !
            }
        }
    }
    return(G)
}

# Listing the matrix is not very informative - we should plot this graph. We'll
# go into more details of the igraph package a bit later, for now we just use it
# to plot:

if (!require(igraph)) {
    install.packages("igraph")
    library(igraph)
}

iG <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(G)
iGxy <- layout_with_graphopt(iG, charge=0.001)   # calculate layout coordinates


# The igraph package adds its own function to the collection of plot()
# functions; R makes the selection which plot function to use based on the class
# of the object that we request to plot. This plot function has parameters
#  layout - the x,y coordinates of the nodes;
#  vertex.color - which I define to color by node-degree
#  vertex size - which I define to increase with node-degree
#  vertex.label - which I set to use our Nnames vector

oPar <- par(mar= rep(0,4)) # Turn margins off
plot(iG,
     layout = iGxy,
     rescale = FALSE,
     xlim = c(min(iGxy[,1]), max(iGxy[,1])) * 1.1,
     ylim = c(min(iGxy[,2]), max(iGxy[,2])) * 1.1,
     vertex.color=heat.colors(max(degree(iG)+1))[degree(iG)+1],
     vertex.size = 800 + (150 * degree(iG)),
     vertex.label = as.character(degree(iG)/2),
#     vertex.label = Nnames,
     edge.arrow.size = 0)
par(oPar)  # reset plot window


# The simplest descriptor of a graph are the number of nodes, edges, and the
# degree-distribution. In our example, the number of nodes was given: N; the
# number of edges can easily be calculated from the adjacency matrix. In our
# matrix, we have entered 1 for every edge. Thus we simply sum over the matrix:
sum(G)

# Is that correct? Is that what you see in the plot?

# Yes and no: we entered every edge twice: once for a node [i,j], and again for
# the node [j, i]. Whether that is correct depends on what exactly we
# want to do with the matrix. If these were directed edges, we would need to
# keep track of them separately. Since we didn't intend them to be directed,
# we'll could divide the number of edges by 2. Why didn't we simply use an
# upper-triangular matrix? Because then we need to keep track of the ordering of
# edges if we want to know whether a particular edge exists or not. For example
# we could sort the nodes alphabetically, and make sure we always query a pair
# in alphabetical order. Then a triangular matrix would be efficient.

# What about the degree distribution? We can get that simply by summing over the
# rows (or the columns):"

rowSums(G)  # check this against the plot!

# Let's  plot the degree distribution in a histogram:
rs <- rowSums(G)
brk <- seq(min(rs)-0.5, max(rs)+0.5, by=1)  # define breaks for the histogram
hist(rs, breaks=brk, col="#A5CCF5",
     xlim = c(-1,8), xaxt = "n",
     main = "Node degrees", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Number")  # plot histogram
axis(side = 1, at = 0:7)

# Note: I don't _have_ to define breaks, the hist() function usually does so
# quite well, automatically. But for this purpose I want the columns of the
# histogram to represent exactly one node-degree difference.

# A degree distribution is actually quite an important descriptor of graphs,
# since it is very sensitive to the generating mechanism. For biological
# networks, that is one of the key questions we are interested in: how was the
# network formed?

# ==============================================================================
#        PART TWO: DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS
# ==============================================================================

# Let's simulate a few graphs that are a bit bigger to get a better sense of
# their degree distributions:
#

# === random graph

     edge.arrow.size = 0)
par(oPar)

# This graph has thirteen singletons and one large, connected component. Many
# biological graphs look approximately like this.

# Calculate degree distributions
dg <- degree(iG200)/2   # here, we use the iGraph function degree()
                        # not rowsums() from base R.
brk <- seq(min(dg)-0.5, max(dg)+0.5, by=1)
hist(dg, breaks=brk, col="#A5CCF5",
     xlim = c(-1,11), xaxt = "n",
     main = "Node degrees", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Number")  # plot histogram
axis(side = 1, at = 0:10)



# Note the characteristic peak of this distribution: this is not "scale-free". Here is a log-log plot of frequency vs. degree-rank:

(freqRank <- table(dg))

     log10(as.numeric(freqRank)), type = "b",
     pch = 21, bg = "#A5CCF5",
     xlab = "log(Rank)", ylab = "log(frequency)",
     main = "200 nodes in a random network")

# === scale-free graph (Barabasi-Albert)

# What does one of those intriguing "scale-free" distributions look like? The
# iGraph package has a function to make random graphs according to the
# Barabasi-Albert model of scale-free graphs. It is: sample_pa(), where pa
# stands for "preferential attachment", one type of process that will yield
# scale-free distributions.


set.seed(31415927)
GBA <- sample_pa(200, power = 0.8)

iGxy <- layout_with_graphopt(GBA, charge=0.0001) # calculate layout coordinates

oPar <- par(mar= rep(0,4)) # Turn margins off

par(oPar)

# This is a very obviously different graph! Some biological networks have
# features that look like that - but in my experience the hub nodes are usually
# not that distinct. But then again, that really depends on the parameter
# "power". Feel encouraged to change "power" and get a sense for what difference
# this makes. Also: note that the graph has only a single component.

# What's the degree distribution of this graph?

# Most nodes have a degree of 1, but one node has a degree of 28.

     log10(as.numeric(freqRank)), type = "b",
     pch = 21, bg = "#A5F5CC",
     xlab = "log(Rank)", ylab = "log(frequency)",
     main = "200 nodes in a preferential-attachment network")

# Sort-of linear, but many of the higher ranked nodes have a frequency of only
# one. That behaviour smooths out in larger graphs:
#
X <- sample_pa(100000, power = 0.8)  # 100,000 nodes
freqRank <- table(degree(X))
plot(log10(as.numeric(names(freqRank)) + 1),

     main = "100,000 nodes in a random, scale-free network")
rm(X)

# === Random geometric graph

# Finally, let's simulate a random geometric graph and look at the degree
# distribution. Remember: these graphs have a high probability to have edges
# between nodes that are "close" together - an entriely biological notion.

# We'll randomly place our nodes in a box. Then we'll define the
# probability for two nodes to have an edge to be a function of their distance.

# Here is a function that makes such graphs. iGraph has sample_grg(), which
# connects nodes that are closer than a cutoff, the function I give you below is
# a bit more interesting since it creates edges according to a probability that
# is determined by a generalized logistic function of the distance. This
# sigmoidal function gives a smooth cutoff and creates more "natural" graphs.
# Otherwise, the function is very similar to the random graph function, except
# that we output the "coordinates" of the nodes together with the adjacency
# matrix. Lists FTW.
#

# ====================================================================
#        PART THREE: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE igraph PACKAGE
# ====================================================================


# == BASICS ==========================================================

# The basic object of the igraph package is a graph object. Let's explore the
# first graph some more, the one we built with our random gene names:
summary(iG)

# This output means: this is an IGRAPH graph, with D = directed edges and N =
# named nodes, that has 20 nodes and 40 edges. For details, see
?print.igraph

mode(iG)
class(iG)

# This means an igraph graph object is a special list object; it is opaque in
# the sense that a user is never expected to modify its components directly, but
# through a variety of helper functions which the package provides. There are
# many ways to construct graphs - from adjacency matrices, as we have just done,
# from edge lists, or by producing random graphs according to a variety of
# recipes, called _games_ in this package.

# Two basic functions retrieve nodes "Vertices", and "Edges":
V(iG)
E(iG)

# As with many R objects, loading the package provides special functions that
# can be accessed via the same name as the basic R functions, for example:

print(iG)
plot(iG)

# ... where plot() allows the usual flexibility of fine-tuning the plot. We
# first layout the node coordinates with the Fruchtermann-Reingold algorithm - a
# force-directed layout that applies an ettractive potential along edges (which
# pulls nodes together) and a repulsive potential to nodes (so they don't
# overlap). Note the use of the degree() function to color and scale nodes and
# labels by degree and the use of the V() function to retrieve the vertex names.
# See ?plot.igraph for details."

iGxy <- layout_with_fr(iG)   # calculate layout coordinates

# Plot with some customizing parameters
oPar <- par(mar= rep(0,4)) # Turn margins off
plot(iG,
     layout = iGxy,
     vertex.color=heat.colors(max(degree(iG)+1))[degree(iG)+1],
     vertex.size = 9 + (2 * degree(iG)),
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5 + (0.05 * degree(iG)),
     edge.arrow.size = 0,
     edge.width = 2,
     vertex.label = toupper(V(iG)$name))
par(oPar)


# == Components

# The igraph function components() tells us whether there are components of the
# graph in which there is no path to other components.
components(iG)

# In the _membership_ vector, nodes are annotatd with the index of the component
# they are part of. Sui7 is the only node of component 2, Cyj1 is in the third
# component etc. This is perhaps more clear if we sort by component index
sort(components(iG)$membership)

# Retrieving e.g. the members of the first component from the list can be done by subsetting:

                                components(iG)$membership == 1  # logical ..
      components(iG)$membership[components(iG)$membership == 1]
names(components(iG)$membership)[components(iG)$membership == 1]



# == RANDOM GRAPHS AND GRAPH METRICS =================================


# Let's explore some of the more interesting, topological graph measures. We
# start by building a somewhat bigger graph. We aren't quite sure whether
# biological graphs are small-world, or random-geometric, or
# preferential-attachment ... but igraph has ways to simulate the basic ones
# (and we could easily simulate our own). Look at the following help pages:

?sample_gnm                      # see also sample_gnp for the Erdös-Rényi models
?sample_smallworld               # for the Watts & Strogatz model
?sample_pa                       # for the Barabasi-Albert model

# But note that there are many more sample_ functions. Check out the docs!

# Let's look at betweenness measures for our first graph: here: the nodes again
# colored by degree. Degree centrality states: nodes of higher degree are
# considered to be more central. And that's also the way the force-directed
# layout drawas them, obviously.

set.seed(112358)
iGxy <- layout_with_fr(iG)   # calculate layout coordinates
oPar <- par(mar= rep(0,4)) # Turn margins off

     vertex.size = 20 + (10 * degree(iG)),
     vertex.label = Nnames,
     edge.arrow.size = 0)
par(oPar)

# == Diameter

diameter(iG)  # The diameter of a graph is its maximum length shortest path.

# let's plot this path: here are the nodes ...
get_diameter(iG)

# ... and we can get the x, y coordinates from iGxy by subsetting with the node
# names. The we draw the diameter-path with a transparent, thick pink line:
lines(iGxy[get_diameter(iG),], lwd=10, col="#ff63a788")

# == Centralization scores

?centralize
# replot our graph, and color by log_betweenness:

bC <- centr_betw(iG)  # calculate betweenness centrality
nodeBetw <- bC$res
nodeBetw <- round(log(nodeBetw +1)) + 1

     vertex.size = 20 + (10 * degree(iG)),
     vertex.label = Nnames,
     edge.arrow.size = 0)

par(oPar)

# Note that the betweenness - the number of shortest paths that pass through a
# node, is in general higher for high-degree nodes - but not always: Eqr2 has
# higher betweenness than Itv7: this measure really depends on the detailed
# local topology of the graph."

# Can you use centr_eigen() and centr_degree() to calculate the respective
# values? That's something I would expect you to be able to do.
#
# Lets plot betweenness centrality for our random geometric graph:

# == CLUSTERING ======================================================

# Clustering finds "communities" in graphs - and depending what the edges
# represent, these could be complexes, pathways, biological systems or similar.
# There are many graph-clustering algorithms. One approach with many attractive
# properties is the Map Equation, developed by Martin Rosvall. See:
# http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216267 and htttp://www.mapequation.org


iGRGclusters <- cluster_infomap(iGRG)
modularity(iGRGclusters) # ... measures how separated the different membership
                         # types are from each other
membership(iGRGclusters) # which nodes are in what cluster?
table(membership(iGRGclusters))  # how large are the clusters?

# The largest cluster has 48 members, the second largest has 25, etc.


# Lets plot our graph again, coloring the nodes of the first five communities by
# their cluster membership:

# first, make a vector with as many grey colors as we have communities ...
commColors <- rep("#f1eef6", max(membership(iGRGclusters)))
# ... then overwrite the first five with "real colors" - something like rust,
# lilac, pink, and mauve or so.

#        PART FOUR: EXPLORE FUNCTIONAL EDGES IN THE HUMAN PROTEOME
# ==============================================================================

# In order for you to explore some real, biological networks, I give you a
# dataframe of functional relationships of human proteins that I have downloaded from the
# STRING database. The full table has 8.5 million records, here is a subset of
# records with combined confidence scores > 980

# The selected set of edges with a confidence of > 980 is a dataframe with about
# 50,000 edges and 6,500 unique proteins. You can load the saved dataframe here
# (and also read more about what the numbers mean at
# http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608232 ).

load("STRINGedges.RData")

head(STRINGedges)


# make a graph from this dataframe
?graph_from_data_frame

gSTR <- graph_from_data_frame(STRINGedges)

# CAUTION you DON'T want to plot a graph with 6,500 nodes and 50,000 edges -
# layout of such large graphs is possible, but requires specialized code. Google
# for <layout large graphs> if you are curious. Also, consider what one can
# really learn from plotting such a graph ...

# Of course simple computations on this graph are reasonably fast:

compSTR <- components(gSTR)
summary(compSTR) # our graph is fully connected!

dg <- degree(gSTR)
hist(log(dg), col="#FEE0AF")
# this actually does look rather scale-free

(freqRank <- table(dg))
plot(log10(as.numeric(names(freqRank)) + 1),
     log10(as.numeric(freqRank)), type = "b",
     pch = 21, bg = "#FEE0AF",
     xlab = "log(Rank)", ylab = "log(frequency)",
     main = "6,500 nodes from the human functional interaction network")

# This looks very scale-free indeed.
#
# Now explore some more:

# === CLIQUES   ========
# Let's find the largest cliques. Remember: a clique is a fully connected
# subgraph, i.e. a subgraph in which every node is connected to every other.
# Biological complexes often appear as cliques in interaction graphs.

clique_num(gSTR)
# The largest clique has 63 members.

largest_cliques(gSTR)[[1]]

# Pick one of the proteins and find out what this fully connected cluster of 63
# proteins is (you can simply Google for the ID). Is this expected?



# === BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY   =======================================

# Let's find the nodes with the 10 - highest betweenness centralities.
#
BC <- centr_betw(gSTR)

# remember: BC$res contains the results
head(BC$res)

BC$res[1]   # betweeness centrality of node 1 in the graph ...
            # ... which one is node 1?
V(gSTR)[1]

# to get the ten-highest nodes, we simply label the elements BC with their
# index ...
names(BC$res) <- as.character(1:length(BC$res))

# ... and then we sort:
sBC <- sort(BC$res, decreasing = TRUE)
head(sBC)

# This ordered vector means: node 3,862 has the highest betweeness centrality,
# node 1,720 has the second highest.. etc.

BCsel <- as.numeric(names(sBC)[1:10])
BCsel
# We can use the first ten labels to subset the nodes in gSTR and fetch the
# IDs...
ENSPsel <- names(V(gSTR)[BCsel])

# We are going to use these IDs to produce some output for you to print out and
# bring to class, so I need you to personalize ENSPsel with the following
# two lines of code:
set.seed(myStudentNumber)
ENSPsel <- sample(ENSPsel)

# We also need to remove the string "9606." from the ID:
ENSPsel <- gsub("9606\\.", "", ENSPsel)

# This is the final vector of IDs.:
ENSPsel

# Could you define in a short answer quiz what these IDs are? And what their
# biological significance is? I'm probably not going to ask you to that on the
# quiz, but I expect you to be able to.

#  Next, to find what these proteins are...

# We could now Google for all of these IDs to learn more about them. But really,
# googling for IDs one after the other, that would be lame. Let's instead use
# the very, very useful biomaRt package to translate these Ensemble IDs into
# gene symbols.

# == biomaRt =========================================================

# IDs are just labels, but for _bio_informatics we need to learn more about the
# biological function of the genes or proteins that we retrieve via graph data
# mining. biomaRt is the tool of choice. It's a package distributed by the
# bioconductor project. This here is not a biomaRt tutorial (that's for another
# day), simply a few lines of sample code to get you started on the specific use
# case of retrieving descriptions for ensembl protein IDs.

if (!require(biomaRt)) {
    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite("biomaRt")
    library("biomaRt")
}

# define which dataset to use ...
myMart <- useMart("ensembl", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")

# what filters are defined?
filters <- listFilters(myMart)
filters

# and what attributes can we filter for?
attributes <- listAttributes(myMart)
attributes

# Soooo many options - let's look for the correct name of filters that are
# useful for ENSP IDs ...
filters[grep("ENSP", filters$description), ]

# ... and the correct attribute names for gene symbols and descriptions ...
attributes[grep("symbol", attributes$description, ignore.case=TRUE), ]
attributes[grep("description", attributes$description, ignore.case=TRUE), ]


# ... so we can put this together: here is a syntax example:
getBM(filters = "ensembl_peptide_id",
      attributes = c("hgnc_symbol",
                     "wikigene_description",
                     "interpro_description",
                     "phenotype_description"),
      values = "ENSP00000000442",
      mart = myMart)

# A simple loop will now get us the information for our 10 most central genes
# from the human subset of STRING.

CPdefs <- list()  # Since we don't know how many matches one of our queries
                  # will return, we'll put the result dataframes into a list.

for (ID in ENSPsel) {
    CPdefs[[ID]] <- getBM(filters = "ensembl_peptide_id",
                          attributes = c("hgnc_symbol",
                                         "wikigene_description",
                                         "interpro_description",
                                         "phenotype_description"),
                          values = ID,
                          mart = myMart)
}

# So what are the proteins with the ten highest betweenness centralities?
#  ... are you surprised? (I am! Really.)

# Final task: Write a loop that will go through your list and
#    --  print each ID,
#    --  print the first column's symbol, and
#    --  print the first column's wikigene description.
#
# (Hint, you can structure your loop in the same way as the loop that
# created CPdefs. )

# Print the R code for your loop and its output for the ten genes onto a sheet
# of paper, write your student number and name on it, and bring this to class.
